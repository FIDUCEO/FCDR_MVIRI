The current Veersion of RICalPy primarily employs python and what 
is available in the community regarding libraries such as numpy or
pandas.
However, some tools had to be additionally coded in fortran/c++/C for
specific tasks of RICalPy. This affects the building procedure.

Step 1:
Build the libraries in folder lib/
  A) nrCrunch (fortran):
    The file cruncher.f contains several tools for effect calculations, 
    e.g. a very fast function for the calculation of latitudes and 
    longitudes. The python libs can be build with:
f2py -c -m cruncher cruncher.f

  B) vax2iee (C):
    This tool takes care of float/double conversion from vax (OpenVMS) to 
    ieee representation. It can be built using swig. 
    +++At present it is not possible to build it on the RedHat VMs
       and therefore the binary _vax2ieee.so is included in the repo++++
ssh -X tclxs17 #opensuse machine
# now cd to lib/vax2ieee/ folder
rm *_wrap.c*
rm *.so
rm *.o
swig -python py_vax2ieee.i
g++ -fPIC -c STAMP_PDL_Vax2Ieee.c py_vax2ieee_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python
g++ -fPIC STAMP_PDL_Vax2Ieee.c convert_vax_data.c -c
g++ -shared convert_vax_data.o STAMP_PDL_Vax2Ieee.o py_vax2ieee_wrap.o -o _vax2ieee.so

Step 2:
Run RICalPy from folder src/; It should find all relevant shared 
object files in their folders.
